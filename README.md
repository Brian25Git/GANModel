# GANModel
Image Generation (computer-chip scratches)
This model utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate images. Specifically, the generation of defective computer chips (scratches) to increase the training data of scratch detection software, improving the accuracy of such software to detect scratches for quality assurance in the manufacturing industry.

The framework of this model is based on Amit Shakya's GAN model for the MNIST dataset (https://github.com/amitshky/GAN).
